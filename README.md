# get_clean_data

This is the end-of-course project for the JHU course on [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/) which is hosted on Coursera.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for working with the data set.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the R programming language, and RStudio which is the defacto tool for working with R. This project repository is on GitHub. The specific versions used in developing this project were ...

* [R ver. 3.6.3](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio ver. 1.2.5003](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [Project repository on GitHub](https://www.github.com/dador92/get_clean_data/)

While earlier versions of these technologies may work, the latest versions are recommended.

### Getting a Copy of the Project to Work With

Please clone the project into your own GitHub account and then access through RStudio using the `File > New Project... > Version Control > Git` command.

## Running the Project
The project can be run using the `run_analysis.R` script in the RStudio console as follows:
```
> source("run_analysis.R")
```

Realistically someone wanting to study the process will `Run` a few line of the script at a time in RStudio. But remember that the script is sequential and must be run that way to successfully execute.
